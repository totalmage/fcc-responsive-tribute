This is a project to complete the "Tribute Page" requirement for the Responsive Web Design Certificate on freecodecamp.org.
The requirements are the following:

X- User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

X- User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

X- User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

X- User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

X- User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

X- User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

X- User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

X- User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

              Russell M. Nelson is perhaps one of the most important men of his
              time. Having contributed greatly to the field of heart surgeries
              and being called as the current leader of one of the most rapidly
              growing religions, progress has been a part of him from the
              beginning and it does not look like he will stop soon.
